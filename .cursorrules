# Project Coding Rules for Cursor AI

## General
- Write clear, concise, and maintainable code
- Always include descriptive comments for non-obvious logic
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes/types)

## Language / Framework
- Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript
- Use ES modules (import/export) over require
- Prefer async/await over raw Promise chains

## React (if applicable)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Separate UI (presentational) and business logic into different components
- Keep components small and reusable

## Style
- Format code according to Prettier defaults
- Limit line length to ~100 characters
- Use consistent spacing and indentation (2 spaces)

## Testing
- Write unit tests for core logic functions
- Use descriptive test names
- Ensure tests run in isolation

## Do Not Do's 
- Do not run dev commands. Tell me when a dev command needs to be run and I will run it.
