## About The Project

Simpsons DLE is a daily guessing game inspired by Wordle, but for Simpsons fans! Each day, a new Simpsons character is featured. Players guess the character using hints such as occupation, first episode, hair color, and more. The game also supports a practice mode with random characters.

**Features:**
- Daily and practice (random) game modes
- Autocomplete guess input with character list
- Color-coded hints (green/red/yellow)
- Character silhouette and reveal
- Guess history and counter
- Responsive, modern UI
